# Neural Network Simulator
A good visualization of how neural networks work.
For help and teaching thanks to BME university of tech MIT department, [AI subject](https://www.mit.bme.hu/oktatas/targyak/vimiac00).

About the training data:
The training data, spambase_train.csv, is a set of email features in columns, and an additional boolean of whether the email is a spam email or a "normal"(?) email. These features include natural text analytics results and emailing data interpolated on real numbers. There are 57 features in this training set, and only one question: whether the email is a spam or not, which is in the 58th column. You should insert this set into the application, and of course set up a network that starts with 57 nodes and ends with 1 node. Enjoy!
